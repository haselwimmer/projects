    "- Analysis of remote sensing data to map and monitor vegetation for priority bond release areas\n",
    "- Use ground data to calibrate vegetation parameters derived from satellite data\n",
    "- Can we use Sentinel data to predict vegetation cover:\n",
    "  - Calibrate Sentinel NDVI using UAS data:\n",
    "    - Directly compare Sentinel NDVI to UAS NDVI by reinterpolating the latter to the Sentinel spatial resolution (20 x 20m pixel = ~0.01 acres); consider collecting UAS data/NDVI over varied expected NDVI values and calculate linear regression between UAS NDVI and Sentinel NDVI; use 70% training and 30% validation.\n",
    "    - Classify UAS data to determine vegetation cover; calculate linear regression model between NDVI and vegetation cover at Sentinel spatial resolution; apply model to Sentinel and compare against validation dataset; consider using footprints of Sentinel pixels to define 'plots' for analysis?\n",
    "    - Validation against field measurements\n",
    "- Can we identify FORB's using Sentinel data:\n",
    "  - Specific FORB's band ratio?\n",
    "- Consider using spectral mixture model as opposed to band ratios? NDVI is sensitive to background soil reflectance."
